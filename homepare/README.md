# Team20's final project - "HomePare"

This is the bare bones for the FrontEnd of Team 20's ReadMe file.

## Project description

HomePare is a home comparison tool for prospective home buyers. Users can record their personal home preferences, search for home listings, sort listings into collections, and view a personalized checklist that compares home listing data to their own personal preferences.

The app begins with registration where a new user is prompted to fill out basic account information. First time users are then led to a questionnaire to identify and record their home preferences (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.). Once a user completes the questionnaire, they are redirected to their user dashboard.

From the dashboard a user has options to search for listings and add them to their collection, view and edit their checklist results, and modify their user account information. When adding listings, a user has the option to simply add it to a provided default collection (My List) or create their own collections. A second comparison feature is accessible when a user views a collection. The user can select multiple listings within an expanded collection and then compare them against each other and their own preferences in a chart.
