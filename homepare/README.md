# Team20's final project - "HomePare"

This is the bare bones for the FrontEnd of Team 20's ReadMe file.

## Project description

Our final project is a checklist app made for homehunters as they view homes for sale. The user can search listings, add listings to their collections, and the app comes with a personalized checklist that compares each home listing's data to the user's personal preferences.

The app begins with registration for a new user, where they will be prompted to fill out their basic account information. Then, the first time user will be led to a page with a questionnaire that records the data and once confirmed will lead the user to their dashboard. From there, users now have access to their listings and their collections on their dashboard, as well as a menu bar with other options. A user can use the menu to navigate to "Add a listing", which will open a page with a search bar where users can search for a home using its address. When they click search, they'll see a listing for that home, which they can add to their collections or listings. They can continue searching and adding homes, or they can navigate to other pages, including a checklist page which shows users their preferences. Users can edit their preferences questions on an edit page, where they can choose to update individual information as they choose to. The users can also navigate to a user account page where they can update their account information, or logout.
